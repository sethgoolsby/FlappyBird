# FlappyBird

The goal of this project was to create a Flappy Birds clone, but using a Finite State Machine and Digital Logic instead of using traditional software design. This project is written in Verilog, which is a hardware description language, meant for an FPGA board that has a VGA display port and several buttons. We used the Nexys Artix-7 board for this project.
